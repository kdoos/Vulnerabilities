TOTOLINK A3002RU-V2.0.0 B20190814.1034 allows authenticated remote 
users to modify the system's 'Run Command'. 
Also vulnerabilities is when router uses remote management function 
through the public-facing IP address on the WAN port. 
Attackers can send prepared POST request to device during administrator 
session is active and also got rce, because in request doesn't requires any 
authenticated token or cookies.

An attacker can use this functionality to execute arbitrary OS commands
on the router. There is also possibility to get shell command  with root priviledge on device.



 Administrator must to login to administrator panel and go to 
 Advanced Setup-> System->Run Command.
 There is possibility to run ping and traceroute but it is also possible
 to change it and run different os command.
 Or Attacker need to send the request to router during admin session.
 On router is busybox module so if run command to get bind shell on port 4444:
 '/bin/busybox telnetd -l/bin/sh -p4444'
